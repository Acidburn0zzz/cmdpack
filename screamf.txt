NAME
----
screamf - .AMF to .S3M converter

SYNOPSIS
--------
*screamf* 'amf_file' 's3m_file'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Converts AMF music files to S3M.  AMF was a format used exclusively by
Otto Chrons' DOS Sound and Music Interface (DSMI) library and Dual
Module Player.  Various DOS games and demos in the 1990s used this
format.  AMF files were the result of running MOD2AMF on an existing
S3M or other module; screamf does the opposite.  It's round-trippable
for the most part.
