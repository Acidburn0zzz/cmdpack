= cmdpack

These are a set of utilities originally released by Neill Corlett
(http://www.neillcorlett.com/cmdpack/), but the upstream has since
vanished from the web.

I don't plan on any major developments, but I'll try to clean up the
utilities at least a little bit.  So far, the most major change is
ecm's name change to bin2ecm, and requires being called with a name of
ecm2bin to do the reverse operation now.  Neill's last version, 1.03,
is completely preserved as the root commit and is tagged.
