= cmdpack

These are a set of utilities originally released by Neill Corlett
(http://www.neillcorlett.com/cmdpack/), but the upstream has since
vanished from the web.

There is some minor restructuring here, and in particular, ecm is
renamed to avoid a conflict with another program. The last (v1.03)
release is fully preserved as the root commit of this repository, and
also tagged.
