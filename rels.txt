NAME
----
rels - Relative searcher

SYNOPSIS
--------
*rels* 'string' 'FILE'...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Searches for a string in a group of files by comparing the relative
difference between each letter.  This allows finding strings in
non-ASCII character sets.  Also attempts double values (e.g. 00=A, 02=B,
04=C) and wide values (every other byte, as in UCS-2).  A staple ROM
hacking tool.

Search strings may include ``.'' characters as wildcards, but must
include at least two non-wildcard characters.
