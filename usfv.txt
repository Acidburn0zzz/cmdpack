NAME
----
usfv - Universal SFV create/verify utility

SYNOPSIS
--------
*usfv* 'c' 'sfvfile' 'FILE'...

*usfv* 'v' 'sfvfile'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
usfv is a utility for creating and verifying SFV (simple file
verification) files, such as those created by Win-SFV32.  A SFV file
constains a list of file names and their corresponding CRC32
checksums.

CRC32 is not a cryptographically secure hash and cannot be used to
ensure that a file was not maliciously modified.
